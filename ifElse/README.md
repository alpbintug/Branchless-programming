### Writing if and else statements without actually writing them

#### Problem: check if the given number is even or odd for first 10k integers greater or equalt to zero.


#### Performance
- Mean execution time for branched_ifElse is 4.396 seconds
- Mean execution time for branchless_ifElse is 4.015 seconds

## Note
This piece of code do not represent Branchless Programming completely but writing if-else (or even if-else if-else) statements without actually writing them and using logical operations instead made a slight performance boost so I posted this method in this repository.
