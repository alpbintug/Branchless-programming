## PROBLEM: You are given a string and you have to switch lower case letters to upper case letters and vice versa.

## OUTPUT:

#### Branched solution:
Starting clock: 104, Stopping clock: 3212, Execution time for branched code is: 3.108000
#### Branchless solution 1:
Starting clock: 3213, Stopping clock: 4890, Execution time for branchless code #1 is: 1.677000
#### Branchless solution 2:
Starting clock: 4891, Stopping clock: 6104, Execution time for branchless code #2 is: 1.213000
